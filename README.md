# emojis.css

### NPM
```sh
npm i emojis.css
```

## Why this?
I was always searching for emojis to use in projects and wound up copying and pasting them from search results. I saw stylesheets that offered png-backed emojis but I wanted to just deliver the natural emojis for the device. Some people called me crazy. Others said it couldn't be done. I didn't check to see if it already had been ([it has](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/emoji.css)). But without further ado, I present the native emoji stylesheet, *emojis.css*.

## Native as in no icons are provided
This stylesheet uses the same (at the very least: similar) naming scheme as github. In fact I just scraped [this gist](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) and converted what wasn't an image to CSS-friendly character codes. UTF-8? I think? To be honest I haven't done a buttload of homework on this project. I had simple needs and this is a simple fix.
