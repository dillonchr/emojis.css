# Native Emoji Stylesheet

I was always searching for emojis to use in projects and realized there's no universal way to display them. I saw stylesheets that offered png-backed emojis but I wanted to just deliver the natural emojis for the device. Some people called me crazy. Others said it couldn't be done. I didn't check to see if it already had been. But without further ado, I present the native emoji stylesheet.

Early version, not super optimized but suits my current needs.
